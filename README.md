# MVP Scope

We plan on recreating Bleacher Report.
Bleacher Report relies on twitter for content and we plan on upgrading this to posts from authors that will cleanup the web pages with more in depth articles.

Bleacher Report does not have a section to comment and we will be focusing on adding the ability to comment on the articles that our authors will be making to give the same sense of community insight to the website that current;y exists from the Twitter captures.

MVP Looks like:
Ability to post, delete and update articles from three authors.
Ability for anyone to comment on these articles.
Articles being relative to specific authors.
Commenters will have the ability to like comments from others.

# User Flow

Each user will be directed to our home page where they can see a feed of posts from different authors. Each post will show the Author’s name, photo & title of the post. Once clicked on, the user will be routed to a different page where they can comment on posts they have chosen. On the top left we will have a logo displayed that will route you back to the homepage. Also on the home page, you can click the Author’s tab and see 3 Author’s.. (Brandon Tobin, Alex Williams & Cagdas Kalsen) under this tab you will see all of the posts from the selected Author. If you click the About Us tab, it will display all 3 Author’s and their LinkedIn/Github links as well as a short description about themselves.
