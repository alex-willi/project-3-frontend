# MVP Scope
We plan on recreating Bleacher Report.
Bleacher Report relies on twitter for content and we plan on upgrading this to posts from authors that will cleanup the web pages with more in depth articles. 

Bleacher Report does not have a section to comment and we will be focusing on adding the ability to comment on the articles that our authors will be making to give the same sense of community insight to the website that current;y exists from the Twitter captures.

MVP Looks like:
Ability to post, delete and update articles from three authors. 
Ability for anyone to comment on these articles.
Articles being relative to specific authors.
Commenters will have the ability to like comments from others.
